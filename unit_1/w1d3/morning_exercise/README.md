## Part 1 - Spectacle
<details><summary>Move windows with ease</summary>
- Spectacle helps you to move and resize your screens with the a few clicks on your keypad. You no longer have to waste time using your mouse to rearrange the size of the screen.
- Not only will this help to save you time, but it will help to add to the illusion that you are a bada$$ h4ck3r.
- Click on this link https://www.spectacleapp.com/ and download Spectacle.
- Once it's downloaded, you should have little glasses at the top, right of your screen.
- Click on these glasses and select `Preferences`.
    <details><summary>Your Spectacle Preferences should have these key shortcuts</summary>

## Part 2 - Command Line

<details><summary>Be a lazy programmer</summary>
- You will find yourself having to re-run applications when testing your app or you will find yourself needing to retype certain lines over and over again. Be lazy! It will give you more energy for the important stuff.
- Open your terminal and let's try out a few of these.
    <details><summary>Command Line Shortcuts</summary>

</details>

## Part 4 - Atom 
- Open Atom so that we can practice these.

<details><summary>HTML Boilerplate</summary>
 - Every HTML document needs the same basic tags. There's an easy way to do this in Atom. 
 - Type `HTML` and hit `tab`. The boilerplate will autocomplete.
</details>
   
<details><summary>Split Screen</summary>
- If you have more than one file that you'd like to look at, you can go up to `View` and then choose how you would like your panes to be displayed.

<details><summary>Wrapping Text</summary>
- You have a limited amount of visible space in your files, so if you want to wrap your text, you should **hightlight all of the text in the file** (remember our shortcuts: Command + A) and use `View`, `Toggle Soft Wrap`.

<details><summary>Commenting Code</summary>
- Whether you're in an HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file, if you want to comment out your code (have the program ignore some lines of code), you can use one command.
- `Command` + `/`
</details>

<details><summary>Indentation</summary>
- Code is indented to show parent/child relationships and emphasize hierarchy.
- When you have time, check out the [AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- For now, let's ensure that your tabs are set currectly: Use soft tabs set to 2 spaces.
- Open Atom, go to Preferences, scroll down to ensure that tabs are set to 2.
- To make it easier to open our files, you can use the keyword `atom` in front of your files (or `atom .` to open all the files in the current folder). To do this, open Atom, click on Atom, and then click on Install Shell Commands. Restart your terminal.
