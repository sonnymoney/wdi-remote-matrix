# Episode X: A New Terminal

A long time ago in a unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who
knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to
enterâ€¦ The Terminal.

Follow the instructions below using all the console commands introduced in
Fundamentals, class, or that you find on your own.

## Learning objective
Today we want you to be comfortable traversing your way through the file system!<br>

## Completion
Do as much as you can! You don't have to complete it all in the next hour. If you don't finish (or even get close to finishing) in time, come back to this lab after you've done your homework this evening.

## Set the Scene

4. In "**galaxy_far_far_away**", make a directory named "**tatooine**" and create the following files in it: "**luke.txt**", "**ben_kenobi.txt**"

5. Inside of "**tatooine**" make a directory called "**millenium_falcon**", and in it create: "**han_solo.txt**", "**chewbaca.txt**"

Already feeling comfortable with these commands and want an extra challenge? Try doing the following:

* Try applying one command to multiple files at once.
* Try applying one command to **all** files in a single directory (where necessery)
* Try applying one command to **all files that match a pattern**.
* Find and use command line shortcuts.
* Try using a mix of absolute and relative paths.
