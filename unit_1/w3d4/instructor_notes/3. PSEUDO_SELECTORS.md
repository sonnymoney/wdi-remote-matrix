## Explain what a pseudo selector is

There are in general two kinds of pseudo selectors

1. Ones that select elements with specific "states"
1. Ones that select certain elements of a set based on where they are in the tree

## Style link and form elements depending on their "state"

1. :hover
	- selects elements that have a mouse "hovering" on top of them
1. :active
	- selects elements that have been clicked on
1. :focus
	- you can use Tab to jump between links and form fields
	- when you do this, the currently selected link is "focused" on
1. :visited
	- selects links that have been visited
1. :checked
	- selects radio button and check boxes in forms that have been selected
	- usually not used to style the input directly, but style sibling elements (https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/)

## Style the first and last elements of a container

1. :first-child
	- selects only elements that are the first child of their parent
1. :first-of-type
	- selects only elements that are the first of their tag type of their parent
	```html
	<section>
		<div>hi</div>
		<p>paragraph</p>
	</section>
	```
	```css
	section :first-of-type {
	  background:yellow; /* both div and p tags will have a yellow background */
	}
	```
1. :last-child
	- selects only elements that are the last child of their parent
1. :last-of-type
	- selects only elements that are the last of their tag type of their parent

## Style an element depending on what child number it is of its parent

### selectors

1. :nth-child()
	- selects only elements that are the nth child of their parent, where n is specified inside the parentheses
1. :nth-of-type()
	- selects only elements that are the nth of their tag type of their parent, where n is specified inside the parentheses
1. :nth-last-child()
	- selects only elements that are the nth to last child of their parent, where n is specified inside the parentheses
1. :nth-last-of-type()
	- selects only elements that are the nth to last of their tag type of their parent, where n is specified inside the parentheses

### what can N be?

1. a number (1st element is 1, not 0)
1. `even` or `odd`
1. a formula in the form of `an + b`
	- you specify `a` and `b` as integers
	- if an element's index equals the value of that equation for some integer n, the rule applies that element
	- examples
		- 3n - indexes selected: 3, 6, 9
		- 3n+1 - indexes selected: 1, 4, 7, 10

## Style an element if it is the only child of its parent

1. :only-child
	- selects elements that are the sole child of their parent
1. :only-of-type
	- selects elements that are the sole child of their tag type of their parent

## Negate a selector

1. :not()
	- selects everything except whatever elements are selected by the selector inside the parentheses

# Activities

## Style link and form elements depending on their "state"
1. In an HTML file, create two links
	- one that goes to a site that you've visited
	- one that goes to a fake url that you haven't visited
1. Style the :hover, :active, :focus, and :visited properties
1. Create a label and a checkbox
1. Hide the checkbox
1. Create a selector for the label so that if the input that it proceeds is checked, it will have a red background

## Style the first and last elements of a container
1. Create four inline-block elements
1. Give each `border-right: 1px solid black`
1. Set it so that the last inline block does not have a right border

## Style an element depending on what child number it is of its parent
1. Create eight elements with widths such that we have two rows of four elements
1. Using only CSS, set it so that the first elements of both rows have a different background color from the other elements of the row

## Negate a selector
1. Create a `section`
1. Inside the `section` tag, create a `p`, a `span`, and a `div` tag
1. Write a CSS rule that will make the background color of the `p` and `div` tags red.  Use only `section` `span` and `:not`.
