## Create HTML for this content
1. ![Mockup](mockup.png)
1. You do not have to style this yet.  Just come up with the tags and structure for the page.
1. URL for image: http://blog.taxact.com/wp-content/uploads/Complete-Guide-to-Employee-Stock-Options-and-Tax-Reporting-Forms.jpg
1. Links do not have to go anywhere.
1. With each tag you create, `git add` the file, make a commit, and push it to origin

## Stretch:

1. Create an about.html which has similar content to this one.  Have the "About" link send you to about.html.  Have "Home" send you to the page you created in the "Create This Mockup" section.
1. Use what you know about CSS from fundamentals to style this.
