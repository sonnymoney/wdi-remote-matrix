## Explain what a form is

A form is a set of fields with which users interact.  Data is often gathered from these fields.

## Use a form tag to set up an interactive space

Container tag for a form.  Has the following attributes, which we don't need to use right now

1. action
1. method

## Use an input element to give the user a place to enter data

Input tags are the most basic and most common way to enter small chunks of data.  They have the following attributes:

- name
	- used by the server to create a property with the given name
- value
	- set an initial value for the input
- type
	- button
		- Defines a clickable button (mostly used with a JavaScript to activate a script)
	- checkbox
		- Defines a checkbox
	- color
		- Defines a color picker
	- date
		- Defines a date control (year, month and day (no time))
	- datetime-local
		- Defines a date and time control (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and fraction of a second (no time zone)
	- email
		- Defines a field for an e-mail address
	- file
		- Defines a file-select field and a "Browse..." button (for file uploads)
	- hidden
		- Defines a hidden input field
		- used on the back end
	- image
		- Defines an image as the submit button
	- month
		- Defines a month and year control (no time zone)
	- number
		- Defines a field for entering a number
	- password
		- Defines a password field (characters are masked)
	- radio
		- Defines a radio button
		- A set of radio buttons must all have the same name attribute
	- range
		- Defines a control for entering a number whose exact value is not important (like a slider control)
	- reset
		- Defines a reset button (resets all form values to default values)
	- search
		- Defines a text field for entering a search string
	- submit
		- Defines a submit button
	- tel
		- Defines a field for entering a telephone number
	- text
		- Default. Defines a single-line text field (default width is 20 characters)
	- time
		- Defines a control for entering a time (no time zone)
	- url
		- Defines a field for entering a URL
	- week
		- Defines a week and year control (no time zone)
- checked
	- set a check box to be checked initially
	- for a collection of radio buttons, set which one is selected initially
- disabled
	- prevent a user from interacting with an input
- maxlength
	- set the maximum length of an inputs value
- placeholder
	- some placeholder text
	- used to prompt the user or explain the input's purpose

## Use a textarea element to give the user a place to enter large text blocks

Contains large chunks of text

## Use a select element, in conjunction with option elements to create a dropdown

- `select` element
	- tag containing many `option` elements
	- set the `name` attribute here
- `option` element
	- `selected` attribute sets which option is initially selected from the dropdown
	- `value` attribute will be the value of the `select` dropdown as a whole.
	- Can have content which is different from `value` attribute
		- allows you to be more verbose for the user

## Use a label to create a clickable space which will also affect a specified input

- Creates an interactive element for users to click on
- This will affect a checkbox/radio button with an `id` that matches the label's `for` attribute value
- Can do some neat things with CSS, labels, and form elements (e.g. CSS only carousels)

1. See what makes them different from each other

## Textareas and dropdowns
1. Create a textarea
1. Create a dropdown that has 5 elements in it

## Use a label to create a clickable space which will also affect a specified input
1. Create a label that, when clicked, will check a checkbox
1. Create three radio buttons and three corresponding labels. Each label should activate a different radio button
