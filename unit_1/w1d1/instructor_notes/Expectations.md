# Setting you up for success

- Ways to avoid distraction
	- Change your voicemail
	- Set auto reply to email
	- Goodbye to friends and family
	- Quit your job/s
	- Send children to daycare
	- Deactivate social media
	- Turn off phone
- If you are late/absent, email all instructors
	- A previous student got into a car accident, went to the hospital, checked herself out of the hospital, and was only late by 15mins
- Check homework by testing, don't wait for feedback. Code quality doesn't matter
- Try to create a relationship with all other students. You don't know when you'll need a second set of eyes. Sometimes bugs are really stupid
	- Help each other out.  You never know which students will get jobs first and can email you other roles
- growth mindset vs fixed mindset
	- focus on the learning process, not on the results of your current task
	- different types of fixed mindsets
- Programming like writing an essay in a language you don't know
- IAs are chosen by those who help a lot
- First job finders are a mix of strong and struggling. They are often a way into a company for others so be friends with everyone
- Plagiarism will get you a job that you'll get fired from
- Project time is community bonding time
- Most mistakes are stupid. Even weak students can spot what your mind is filling in. Like glossing over spelling mistakes
- Bringing up mistakes during class often illuminates good points to talk about
- Projects and grades mean nothing. The education matters
- Code quality doesn't matter.  Only problems solving
- You can't compare students. Not school, where everyone comes in with roughly equivalent experience
- Don't let problems of any kind fester. Bring them up immediately
- We only "open the doors" you have to walk through the door
- GA name means nothing
	- The education is priceless
	- Bootcamps have not been around long enough to gain clout
	- We help people of all levels.  Some bootcamps only let people in who already have programming experience and will give them a good reputation.
- learning how to debug and read documentation/articles/forums takes practice
- development is like building a recipe, it's just a series of basic steps
- learn what kind of mistakes you make
- type things out, don't copy and paste.  Copy and pasting takes your mind off of what you're doing.
- there is a disconnect between knowing it at a conceptual level and being able to use it
- just because you can look at code and understand it, doesn't mean you can build something
- can usually receive partial refund and continue in another course if withdrawing for family/external issues.  Not for plagiarism.  Come to us before doing anything extreme
- increasing levels of independence: lecture -> lab -> homework -> project
- additional materials are a fallback, try to do as much on your own as possible
- learn to test your code, come up with ways to break software.  Testing edge cases is crucial to life/programming
- Community is best aspect of GA. Help with work and finding work
