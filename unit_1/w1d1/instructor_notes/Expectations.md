# Setting you up for success

- Ways to avoid distraction
	- Change your voicemail
	- Set auto reply to email
	- Goodbye to friends and family
	- Quit your job/s
	- Send children to daycare
	- Deactivate social media
	- Turn off phone
- If you are late/absent, email all instructors
	- A previous student got into a car accident, went to the hospital, checked herself out of the hospital, and was only late by 15mins
- Check homework by testing, don't wait for feedback. Code quality doesn't matter
- Try to create a relationship with all other students. You don't know when you'll need a second set of eyes. Sometimes bugs are really stupid
	- Help each other out.  You never know which students will get jobs first and can email you other roles
- growth mindset vs fixed mindset
	- focus on the learning process, not on the results of your current task
	- different types of fixed mindsets
		-
- Programming like writing an essay in a language you don't know
- IAs are chosen by those who help a lot
- First job finders are a mix of strong and struggling. They are often a way into a company for others so be friends with everyone
- Plagiarism will get you a job that you'll get fired from
- project time is community bonding time
- Most mistakes are stupid. Even weak students can spot what your mind is filling in. Like glossing over spelling mistakes
- Bringing up mistakes during class often illuminates good points
- Projects and grades mean nothing. The education matters
- Code quality doesn't matter
- Can't compare with other students. Not school, where everyone comes in with roughly equivalent experience
- Don't let problems fester. Bring them up immediately
- We open doors they walk through
- Ga name means nothing. Education is priceless. Bootcamps have not been around long enough to gain clout. We help people of all levels, not just smarties which is a virtuous cycle
- learning to debug and read docs/stack overflow takes experience, not brains or teaching.  Matt Short story
- focus is crucial: could mention something that you could struggle over for hours
- development is like building a recipe
- learn what kind of mistakes you make
- Type things out
- there is a disconnect between knowing it at a conceptual level and being able to use it
- just because you can take code apart, doesn't mean you can build it
- can usually receive partial refund and continue in another course if withdrawing for family/external issues.  Not for plagiarism.  Come to us before doing anything extreme
- increasing levels of independance, lecture, lab, homework, project
- additional materials are a fallback, try to do as much on your own as possible
- No distractions
- learn to test your code, come up with how to break software.  Testing edge cases is crucial to life/programming
- Community is best aspect of GA. Help with work and finding work
