##   Describe what git is and what it does

- Git is just a tool that allows you to move project specific files from your "local" (or personal) computer to another internet-connected computer which is acting as a central location for your code.  This other computer is called a "remote repository."
- All other computers that want to contribute to this specific project, will use the same remote repository (central computer), but send files from their own local computers.
