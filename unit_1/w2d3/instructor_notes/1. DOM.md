## Describe what the DOM is

- The Document Object Model is just a way of representing our HTML using JavaScript objects.
- There is a global `document` variable that is always available to us whenever we use JS in the browser
	- this variable contains methods that we can use whenever we want to look at or alter the DOM

## Inspect the DOM using Chrome's Developer Tools

Whenever you want to inspect the DOM of a web page, you can right click somewhere on the page in Chrome and choose Inspect from the drop down.  This will allow us to see updates to the HTML in real time

## Use JS to find an element in the DOM

Use `document.querySelector()` to find an element in the DOM

- e.g. `document.querySelector('div');` will give us the first div that's available to us
- starts at the root element (`<html>`) and performs a depth first search
	- looks at children of current element and their children before moving onto a sibling of the current element

## Alter an element's HTML

We can assign the return value of `document.querySelector()` to a variable.

```javascript
var foundDiv = document.querySelector('div');
```

- The return value of querySelector, and therefore the variable `foundDiv` is itself an object which has properties
- We can change the content of a DOM element (and therefore the HTML in the web page) by altering the .innerHTML property

```javascript
var foundDiv = document.querySelector('div');
foundDiv.innerHTML = 'awesome';
```

## Get an element's attribute

We can get an element's attribute with `.getAttribute()`

```javascript
var foundDiv = document.querySelector('div');
var divAttribute = foundDiv.getAttribute('foo');
```

## Set an element's attribute

We can set an element's attribute with `.setAttribute()`

```javascript
var foundDiv = document.querySelector('div');
foundDiv.setAttribute('foo', 'bar');
```

## Get a list of the classes given to an element

We can see the different classes on an element with the `.classList` property

```javascript
var foundDiv = document.querySelector('div');
var divClasses = foundDiv.classList;
```

## See if a class has been added to an element

The .classList property of an element is not a simple array, though.  It's actually an object that has properties.

We can use the `.contains()` method of the classList property of an element to see if that element has a class added to it

```javascript
var foundDiv = document.querySelector('div');
var divClasses = foundDiv.classList;
divClasses.contains('awesome-class');
```

## Add a class to an element

We can add classes to an element using the `.add()` method of the classList property of an element

```javascript
var foundDiv = document.querySelector('div');
foundDiv.classList.add('awesome-class');
```

## Remove a class from an element

To remove a class, if it exists, use the `.remove()` method of the classList property of an element

```javascript
var foundDiv = document.querySelector('div');
foundDiv.classList.remove('awesome-class');
```

## Toggle a class on an element

The `.toggle()` method of the classList property of an element will add the class if it doesn't exist, otherwise it will remove it

```javascript
var foundDiv = document.querySelector('div');
foundDiv.classList.toggle('awesome-class');
```

## Create a new element

The `document` object also has a `.createElement()` method which allows us to create an element

```javascript
var newElement = document.createElement('div');
```

- We can alter this element using .innerHTML, setAttribute, .classList, etc just like any other element
- The element has not been added to the DOM yet, though.  It's just floating out in space

## Append a child to an element's list of children

- To add this floating element to the DOM, we must append it to an element's list of children
- To do this, each DOM node has an `.appendChild()` method which does exactly this

```javascript
var newElement = document.createElement('div');
newElement.innerHTML = 'foo' //optional
document.querySelector('section').appendChild(newElement); //the section tag has a new child: newElement
```

## Remove a child of an element

To remove a DOM element, first find it, find its parent, and then call `.removeChild()` on the parent, passing in the child that needs to be removed

```javascript
var parent = document.querySelector('section');
var child = document.querySelector('section div');
parent.removeChild(child);
```

## Perform querySelector on a DOM node

- Each DOM node has a `.querySelector()` property on it
- You can perform a search just within a give DOM node
- This can be helpful later on in situations where you're programmatically looping through elements and want to find something within a current element without having to know the name of it

```javascript
var parent = document.querySelector('section');
var child = parent.querySelector('div'); //search just within the section tag
```

## Find multiple elements in the DOM

- Up until now, we've only been finding one element with querySelector.
- We can find multiple results using `document.querySelectorAll()`
	- this essentially returns an array
- We can perform bulk actions by looping through the results of querySelectorAll

```javascript
var allDivs = document.querySelectorAll('div');
for(var i = 0; i < allDivs.length; i++){
	allDivs[i].setAttribute('foo', 'bar');//do anything to the current element
}
```
