# CSS - Transform

## Lesson Objectives

1. Use the CSS3 transform property to visually manipulate DOM elements in a 2D space
1. Use the CSS3 transform property to visually manipulate DOM elements in a 3D space
1. Explain why using transform for animation is better than using position

## Use the CSS3 transform property to visually manipulate DOM elements in a 2D space

1. transform:rotate(10deg);
1. transform:scale(1.1);
1. transform:translateX(10px);
1. transform:skewX(45deg);

You can perform multiple transforms in one statement

1. transform: scale(2) skewY(0.3) rotate(4deg);

## Use the CSS3 transform property to visually manipulate DOM elements in a 3D space

The Z axis extends out of the screen

1. rotateX();
1. rotateY();
1. rotateZ();
1. translateX();
1. translateY();
1. translateZ();
1. scaleX();
1. scaleY();
1. scaleZ();

If you know the math, you can write your own transformation matrix
	- This is how transformations work behind the scenes

1. matrix(n,n,n,n,n,n)
1. matrix3d(n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n)

Transforms are better for animation for two reasons

1. When elements are changed in the DOM, the browser checks to see if other elements are being pushed around.  When using transforms, the browser doesn't do this.
1. If you're doing a 3D transform, the computer's GPU is engaged, which is really fast

Example: `transition: transform 1s ease-in-out;`

# Activities

## Use the CSS3 transform property to visually manipulate DOM elements in a 2D space
1. Create a 100px by 100px square box that has a background color
1. Rotate it 45 degrees
1. Scale it so it is twice as big
1. Translate it along the X axis by 200px

## Use the CSS3 transform property to visually manipulate DOM elements in a 3D space
1. Create a 100px by 100px square box that has a background color
1. Rotate it 180 degrees along the X axis
1. Rotate it 180 degrees along the Y axis

## Explain why using transform for animation is better than using position
1. Duplicate the previous exercises, but add the transform to the hover state of the element
1. Add a transition on the transform property so that it animates in and out
	- make sure the transition is NOT in the `:hover` rule
