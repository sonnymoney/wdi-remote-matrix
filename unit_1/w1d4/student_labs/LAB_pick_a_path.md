# PICK-A-PATH


Remember those pick-a-path books where you could 'choose your own adventure'? Make your own pick-a-path adventure!

### DUNGEON ADVENTURE

- Your adventurer is going to explore a dungeon!

**YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE**

- Set up your user's data:
	- make an array with the user's belongings: a sword, a potion, and Tums.
	- make an array of potential treasures.
	- make a separate hitpoints variable and give the user 10 hitpoints.
	- make a damage variable and make it so the less hardy the adventurer is (the less hitpoints they have), the less damage they can do.

- Welcome your user with a prompt and ask for the user's name.

- Send your user a message with their name in the console, and list the user's belongings and hitpoints and random treasure item.

<br>

**BEGIN!!**

Use prompts and conditionals to direct your program flow.

- If your adventurer is ready, send them a console.log telling them that they are entering the dungeon. 

- Give your user a choice. Take the left passage or the right passage?

- If they take the left passage, they will see two doors. They can choose to open either one of these doors.

- If your user opens door1, they will receive another potion! Add another potion to the array of belongings and update the user.

- If your user take the right passage, they will arrive at an underground lake. They can choose to dive into the lake or continue down the passage.

- If your user dives into the lake, they lose an item from their belongings! Remove an item from the array and update the user. You user will then become a Lake Dweller forever, unfortunately.

- If your user continues down the passage, they arrive at a Crystal Plinth. On the plinth are three crystals. The user can put two of these crystals together and will receive either a bonus or punishment depending on which crystals the user puts together.
	- `crystal1` and `crystal2`: they get 100 extra hitpoints!
	- `crystal2` and `crystal3`: their name is changed to 'Slimy Tim'
	- `crystal1` and `crystal3`: they receive a special power called 'Energy Blast'. How would you represent this in your data?
	
- If your user opened door2 by going down the left passage, they meet a bat called 'Velma' who will travel with them. Give Velma an array of things to say! When it's time for Velma to speak, randomly choose one of those things.

- What happens from here is up to you!


TIPS: 

* Focus on acheiving just one thing at a time. 

* Test your code thoroughly.

* The mark of a good developer is the humility to test every single piece before moving on. Make sure it works! There is no rush!
